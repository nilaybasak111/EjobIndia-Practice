Class component ----  It has a specific lifecycle . It follows the life cycle methods  through out its execution.

Functional component ---- We do not have any lifecycle methods. Functional component does not have a lifecycle.

Class Component ---- it has 4 states :

1. Initialisation state (state 1): it will initialise the state object and the props.
    
     constructor()----> it will initialise the state and props.

2. Mounting state / Loading state (state 2): in this state the class component will
be loaded .

   componentWillMount()
   render()----> this will return from the component
   componentDidMount()

3. Updating state (state 3): when we will update any state property in my component 
using setState() then my component will move to the updating state.

     shouldComponentUpdate() ---> it is a boolean functions which returns true/false
	 if this method will return false then the state update will not be done.
	 
	 componentWillUpdate()
	 render() ----->this is again called here to show the updated state value.
     componentDidUpdate()

4. Unmounting state / Unloading state (state 4): When my component will be unloaded
then it will be in unmounting state.
     
	 componentWillUnmount()
