        Hello, this is a sticky div. Scroll down to see the effect.The big point here is that you can target elements that have combinations of class es and ID s by stringing those selectors together without spaces. For example, if you have a class called .foo and an ID called #bar, you can target them together like this: .foo#bar. This will only select elements that have both the class and the ID. You can also use this technique to target elements that are nested inside other elements. For example, if you have a div with an ID of #container and you want to target all the paragraphs inside it, you can do it like this: #container p. This will select all the paragraph elements that are descendants of the element with the ID of container.
